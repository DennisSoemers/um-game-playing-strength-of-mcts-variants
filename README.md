# UM - Game-Playing Strength of MCTS Variants

This repository hosts files for our Kaggle Competition: ["UM - Game-Playing Strength of MCTS Variants"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/um-game-playing-strength-of-mcts-variants).

- The [/games/test/](/games/test) directory contains the `.lud` files for all the games that were used for the competition's test data. These may all be loaded and played in [Ludii](https://ludii.games/). These files were primarily written by Ã‰ric Piette, Achille Morenville, and Matthew Stephenson in preparation of this competition.
