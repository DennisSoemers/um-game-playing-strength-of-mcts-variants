        (rules "The game is played on a Celtic-inspired board. At the beginning of the game, each player controls 12 lights, which are randomly placed on the board. Players take turns moving their own lights as Knights in Chess. This move will extinguish all adjacent lights and activate any unlit adjacent cells. The objective of the game is to strategically move your lights to turn off all of your opponentâ€™s lights, thereby winning the game.")
